# Apes

Welcome to my static website generator. It's based on

-   [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy)
-   [eleventy-duo](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo) for the theme. You can see it running [here](https://eleventyduo.netlify.app)

## Northstar

The goal is to provide a modular, cheap and practical way of building a website to express ourselves.

For the moment it's very limited in terms of design and functionalities. But it's self-hostable.

## Use it

You can clone it and start writing but in my mind this project is meant to be used as a dependencies.
You write your content in markdown, reference this project, push your code and your website is built & deployed.
